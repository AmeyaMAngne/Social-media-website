I have developed a social media website currently in its initial phase. Users can create posts using the "Create Post" option and view them in the home section. They also have the ability to delete posts. The website has been built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React.js, and Redux.js. In the future, I plan to add more dynamic features and functionalities to enhance the user experience.
